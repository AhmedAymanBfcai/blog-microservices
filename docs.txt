PORTS LIST:
posts: 4000 -> 4000
comments: 6000 -> 4001
client: 3000
event-bus: 7000 -> 4005
query: 8000 -> 4002
moderation: 9000 -> 4003

// We will use query service to make a request to get a full listing of all the different posts and their associated comments "update" events
// Moderation service will watch for events 

- Why Docker?
Running our app right now makes big assumptions about our env and it requires some knowledge of how to start (npm start)
Docker sovles both these issues. containers wrap up everything that is needed for a program and how to start and run it.

- Why K8s?
Kubernetes is a tool for running bunch of diff containers.
We give it some configuration to describe how we want our containers to run and interact with each other.
